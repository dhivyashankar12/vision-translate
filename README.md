# Vision-Translate

## Description

**Vision-Translate** is a powerful web application that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR), multilingual translation, and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies. It allows users to upload images containing text, extract and translate the text into their preferred language, and listen to the translated output as audio â€” bridging communication gaps across languages and formats.

## Features

- **Image-to-Text Conversion**  
  Extract text from uploaded images using OCR.

- **Language Translation**  
  Translate the extracted text into a wide range of supported languages.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
  Convert the translated text into natural-sounding audio, enabling users to hear the content.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  Supports popular languages like English, Tamil, Hindi, French, Chinese, and more.

- **Clean, Interactive UI**  
  Simple and responsive interface using Flask and Dropzone.js for drag-and-drop uploads.
